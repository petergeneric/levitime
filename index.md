## levitime.com - Cerro Gordo Denim Reference Time index

This is a dumb site that records the point in [Ghost Town Living](https://www.youtube.com/c/GhostTownLiving) videos where denim is first referenced.

### Denim?!

Denim! Ghost Town Living is a YouTube channel by Brent Underwood about living in the abandoned mining ghost town of Cerro Gordo, California. He explores the beautiful landscape, learns about the town's history and goes into the old abandoned mine shafts - and is always seeking the most elusive of prey, antique denim (which can fetch quite a price on auction sites!)

I decided to create this dataset because of how often Brent references denim in his searches
